### Hello!

There isn't much to see here. I use GitHub for side projects, proof of concepts, and Optimizely developer community stuff. Day-to-day, I use Azure DevOps for work at Rightpoint. 

Some other things to do: 
* Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewnull/).
* Read my occasional post at the [Optimizely Developer Community Blog](https://world.optimizely.com/blogs/drew-null/).
* Check out my wife's website: [Lipeng Chen Music](https://www.lipengchen.com). This was my foray into the jamstack with Gatsby and Netlify, and was very fun to design and build. 

Thanks for visiting!
